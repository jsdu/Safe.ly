A notification app for Android using Muse headset

Created for AngelHack Montreal

The Muse headband pairs with your Android phone via Bluetooth and sends Beta EEG signals to 

detect eye closing and nodding off. Once the driver begins nodding off, the phone will ring and buzz to

calmly warn you, the driver, of the potential dangers of drowsy driving. 

Pitched idea at Angelhack to a panel of judges and an audience of 100+ hackers. Chosen as top 5 team by 

judges, and top hack overall on the Muse. Received a free Muse headband.
